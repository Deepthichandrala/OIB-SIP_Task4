# OIB-SIP_Task4
It is about the fourth task assigned by Oasis Infobyte  internship in the domain of DataScience

ðŸ”¶ Project Overview In this project, I developed an email spam detector using Python and machine learning techniques. The goal was to automatically classify incoming emails as either spam or legitimate (ham). Here are the key components of the project: ðŸ”¹ Utilizing Python: I leveraged Python for building the email spam detector. Pythonâ€™s versatility and rich ecosystem of libraries make it an excellent choice for machine learning tasks. ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning Algorithms: To train the model, I explored various machine learning algorithms. These algorithms learned from labeled data to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails. ðŸ”¹ Label Encoding: Since machine learning models require numerical input, I implemented label encoding. This process transformed categorical features (such as email labels) into numerical representations. ðŸ”¹ Logistic Regression: For the classification task, I chose Logistic Regression. Itâ€™s a widely used algorithm for binary classification, making it suitable for distinguishing spam from non-spam emails. ðŸ”¹ Custom Prediction Inputs: The trained model allows users to input custom email content for prediction. It predicts whether the email is spam or not based on the learned patterns.
